Problema:
On a positive integer, you can perform any one of the following 3 steps. 
1.) Subtract 1 from it. ( n = n - 1 )
2.) If its divisible by 2, divide by 2.
3.) If its divisible by 3, divide by 3.
Now the question is, given a positive integer n, find the minimum number of steps that takes n to 1
eg: 
1.)For n = 1 , output: 0       
2.)For n = 4 , output: 2  (4/2 = 2/2 = 1)
3.)For n = 7 , output: 3  (7-1 = 6/3 = 2/2 = 1)
